A feature map $\mathbb X^{H*W*C}$ is separated into several parts by sliding windows, so it becomes $\mathbb X^{N*N*H'*W'*C}$, where $C$, $N$, $H$, $H'$, $W$, $W'$ represents its channel, window size, input height, new height, input width and new width. Noted that the new height/width equals windows' vertical/horizontal steps.

Then a part of feature map is denoted as $ X \in \mathbb R^{N*N*C} $ . And our kernel $Z\in \mathbb R^{K*K*N*N*C} $ is defined as

 $Z_{i,j,m,n}=\sum_{(i,j)\in (K,K)} \sum_{(m,n)\in (N,N)}[F_{i,j}(X)]_{m,n}) $,  $F(X)\in R^{N*N}$ is a scalar weight map.

Output of this part of feature map is denoted as $ Y \in \mathbb R^{K*K*C} $ where $K$ refers to its output size, defined as

$Y_{i,j}=\sum_{(m,n)\in (N,N)} Z_{i,j,m,n}X_{m,n}$ 

Now the new feature map becomes $\mathbb Y^{K*K*H'*W'*C}$, we just resize it to $\mathbb Y^{KH'*KW'*C}$, which is the final output. So the scale ratio is $\frac {KH'} {H} \approx \frac {K} {s}$, where $s$ represents the stride of sliding window.
